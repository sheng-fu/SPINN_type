# Stack-augmented Parser-Interpreter Neural Network

This repository contains the source code based on the paper [A Fast Unified Model for Sentence Parsing and Understanding][1] and [original codebase][9]. For a more informal introduction to the ideas behind the model, see this [Stanford NLP blog post][8].


The included implementations are:

- A **Python/Chainer** implementation of SPINN using a naïve stack representation (named `fat-stack`)

## Python code

The Python code lives, quite intuitively, in the `python` folder. We used this code to train and test the SPINN models before publication.

### Installation

Requirements:

- Python 2.7
- Chainer 1.17
- CUDA >= 7.0
- CuDNN == v4 (v5 is not compatible with our Theano fork)

Install all required Python dependencies using the command below.

    pip install -r python/requirements.txt

### Running the code

The main executable for the SNLI experiments in the paper is [fat_classifier.py](https://github.com/mrdrozdov/spinn/blob/chainer-skeleton-clean/python/spinn/models/fat_classifier.py), whose flags specify the hyperparameters of the model. You can specify the gpu id using the `--gpu <gpu_id>` flag. Uses the CPU by default.

Here's a sample command that runs a fast, low-dimensional CPU training run, training and testing only on the dev set. It assumes that you have a copy of [SNLI](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) available locally.

    PYTHONPATH=spinn/python \
        python2.7 -m spinn.models.fat_classifier --data_type snli \
        --training_data_path snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl \
        --eval_data_path snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl \
        --embedding_data_path spinn/python/spinn/tests/test_embedding_matrix.5d.txt \
        --word_embedding_dim 5 --model_dim 10

For full runs, you'll also need a copy of the 840B word 300D [GloVe word vectors](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).

### Viewing Summaries in Tensorboard

To view some statistics in Tensorboard, make sure to turn the "write_summary" flag on. In other words, your run command should look something like this:

    PYTHONPATH=spinn/python \
        python2.7 -m spinn.models.fat_classifier --data_type snli \
        --training_data_path snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl \
        --eval_data_path snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl \
        --embedding_data_path spinn/python/spinn/tests/test_embedding_matrix.5d.txt \
        --word_embedding_dim 5 --model_dim 10 \
        --write_summaries True

You'll also need to install [Tensorflow](http://tflearn.org/installation/#tensorflow-installation).
